  # Weight of getting nothing

  # All items of the group
  # Items will be chosen randomly by their `weight`. Chance of getting of specific item is weight/total_weight
  # If `weight` is not specified, it will default to 1
  # `amount` can be specified either as a range from 1, or by a single number
  # If `override-amount` is not specified, original amount will be used instead.
